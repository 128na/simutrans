<h1>Signals usage</h1><br>
<p>

<em>Basic stop signals</em><br>
The most basic type of signal is the ones only showing two aspects. Another word for the signal could be a "two aspect signal", but since a signal needs to have two aspects in order to be a signal at all (as opposed to a sign which have only one "aspect"), they are also called a "basic signal" or "stop signal".<br>
The two signal states with their meaning: <br>
1 - <it>DANGER</it>: Stop in front of signal<br>
2 - <it>CLEAR</it>: Proceed<br><br>

The signal is in no way telling the train driver about the states of any of the forthcomming signals, only that the driver may proceed behind the signal to the next signal or to its stop.<br><br>


<em>Distant signals</em><br>
Distant signals, presignals and repeater signals are all used only to tell the upcoming train at what state the next signal is. The signals are not "real" signals, and therefore, trains will not stop in front of them. 
Distant signals have two states:<br>
1 - <it>CAUTION</it>: Expect next signal to be at danger<br>
2 - <it>CLEAR</it>: Expect next signal to be at clear<br><br>

Distant signals behave differently depending on which working method they use:<br><br>
- <it>"Absolute block":</it><br>
Presignals using absolute block behaves a bit different to presignals using other systems by alarming the approaching train of the states of ALL of the signals it will face using the same signalbox as the presignal. If all signals facing the train are clear, the presignal will be set to clear, however if only one signal are at danger, the presignal will also be at danger. Therefore presignals must be placed BEFORE the first stop signal of the signalbox to have the effect.
<br><br>

For the rest of the working methods, they will warn for the next signal en route, even if that is controlled from another signal box (exception is for "Time interval" system, which also needs to be for the same signalbox)<br>

<it>Placement:</it><br>
Obviously, presignals are supposed to be placed en route at a distance before the signals they should warn for. The most optimum distance of a presignal in front of its signal (or signal group if it uses absolute block), is the same distance as the braking distance of the train with the longest braking distance.
<br><br><br>

<em>Three- or more aspect stop signals</em><br>
Signals which have presignals integrated to the stopsignal are called "Multiple aspect signals". A signal may have up to 5 aspects:<br>
1 - <it>DANGER</it>: Stop in front of signal<br>
2 - <it>CLEAR</it>: Proceed, next signal will also show clear (next two if 4 aspects, next three if 5 aspects)<br>
3 - <it>CAUTION</it>: Proceed, but next signal will be at danger<br>
4 - <it>PRELIMINARY CAUTION</it>: Proceed, but second next signal will be at danger<br>
5 - <it>ADVANCED CAUTION</it>: Proceed, buth third next signal will be at danger<br>
Note that the CLEAR aspect depends on whether this is a 3,4 or 5 aspect signal.<br><br>
The core function of such a signal is to rize the density of the tracks. The more aspects, the smaller blocks of tracks one can create without compromizing with lower top speeds, thus creating room for more trains on the tracks. Therefore, the most effective way of using multi aspect signals are at lines with a big traffic demand.<br>

Multiaspect signals are mostly used with the "track circuit block" system and also possibly the "cab signal" system, however other working methods also make use of more than two aspects:<br><br>

- <it>"Absolute block":</it><br>
The absolute block system uses a signal that is also called a <it>"Combined signal"</it>. This is a three aspect signal, and the third aspect (CAUTION) is controlled from the next signalbox on the line. For this functionality to work, the next signalbox must also be in range of the combined signal, otherwise no presignal aspects are shown.<br><br>

- <it>"Time intevall":</it><br>
The "Time intervall" system uses a signal with three states (also called a <it>"Vane signal"</it>). It is clear at default, and will set to danger whenever a train is passing. The states of the signal is then determined by the time since the last train passed the signal:<br>
1 - <it>DANGER</it>: Less than 5 in-game minutes since last train: Stop<br>
2 - <it>CAUTION</it>: More than 5 minutes since last train: Proceed at half line speed or half the signal's sighting speed<br>
3 - <it>CLEAR</it>: More than 10 minutes since last train: Proceed at full speed<br><br>


<it>Placement:</it><br>
If the signals are set too close to each other, the train might not be able to drive at its full potential due to its braking distance beeing too long. However, if they are spaced out too much, you potentially loose capacity on your tracks.<br>
The optimum distance between multiple aspect signals are for:<br>
- <it>Three aspect signals:</it> longest braking distance of a train.<br>
- <it>Four aspect signals:</it> longest braking distance of a train, divided in 2.<br>
- <it>Five aspect signals:</it> longest braking distance of a train, divided in 3.<br>
The brake distance of a convoy is shown as "brakes from maxspeed" in the <a href="depot.txt">vehicle depot</a>.
<br><br><br>

<em>Moving block signals</em><br>
When a train passes a moving block signal (or beacon), it will drive in the "moving block" working mode. After having passed such a signal or beacon, the train will remain in this working mode until it passes another type of signal (eg a track circuit signal), stops at a station or gets beyond the reach of the last passed beacon (both last cases will make it go to "drive by sight").
<br><br>
<it>Placement:</it><br>
A beacon should be placed on the entrence of a doubble tracked line. If there are stations along the line, the train need to pass a new beacon again.
If using single tracked lines, be carefull to create a directional reservation BEFORE the train enters the single track, otherwise deadlocks may arize.

<em>Directional reservations</em><br>
A directional reservation is created when a train books a route to a bidirectional signal. The directional reservation is then created behind that signal and only ends at the next <it>oneway sign</it>. The working modes that supports directional reservation (and bidirectional signals) are: track circuit block, cab signalling and moving block.<br><br>
<it>How to:</it><br>
This is how to make a failproof directional reservation:<br>
- At the end of the passing loop, put a singlefaced cab- or track circuit signal (NOT a moving block signal).<br>
- Put a bidirectional cab-, track circuit- or moving block signal as the first signal the train will pass.<br>
- Make sure that both
a ends of the single tracked stretch have this setup.
