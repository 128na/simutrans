<em>Working methods</em><br>
Signals are working with so called working methods, which will determine how the signal will behave and how the train will reserve the track beyond the signal. Different working methods represents different real life rail systems, and there are different signals available to the various working methods.<br>
Whenever the train leaves the depot or leaves a platform with no signals on, it will default to the Drive by Sight working method (although with some exceptions: se the link below).<br>

<em>Signalboxes</em><br>
A signal can't just be built as a standalone signal: They need signalboxes in order to be built. A signalbox is in the real world the shelf or the building from which the signals are controlled. Newer techniques allows for more efficient signal systems with greater numbers and more remote controlled signals. In Simutrans, different signalboxes allows for different signals, simulating the different eras and techniques.<br><br>

<em>Unidirectional</em><br>
Signals are unidirectional signals that do not prevent trains passing in the opposite direction. Trains passing in the opposite direction will ignore the signals completely.<br>
Some signals using certain working methods can also be built as bidirectional signals, controling traffic from both directions.<br><br>


<em>Multiple aspect signals</em><br>
A signal may have up to 5 aspects, in addition to aspects for permissive signals and choose signals showing alternative routes. Not all paksets make use of all of the aspects and the graphics of the signals might be very different between paksets.<br>
The ordinary five aspects with their meaning are:<br>
- <it>DANGER</it>: Stop in front of signal<br>
- <it>CLEAR</it>: Proceed<br>
- <it>CAUTION</it>: Proceed, but next signal will be at danger<br>
- <it>PRELIMINARY CAUTION</it>: Proceed, but second next signal will be on danger<br>
- <it>ADVANCED CAUTION</it>: Proceed, buth third next signal will be on danger<br>

<em>Choose signals</em><br>
Choose signals serves two functions: They will guide the train to an empty platform at the station, and it will guide a train through a station if the mainline route is occupied.<br>
To make use of this second function, you need to place an <it>end of choose </it>sign outside all the exits of the station. When a train aproach the choose signal, it will be given a route all the way till its destination or the "end of choose" sign, whichever is encountered first.<br>

<em>Permissive signals</em><br>
Permissive signals is used to increase line capacity. When a train that is brought to a stand at a permissive signal at danger, it may proceed beyond the signal at drive by sight. This is only possible where the signal controls a section of straight, unidirectional track. If there are junctions, the permissive functionality is disabled and the signal works as an ordinary signal.<br>
